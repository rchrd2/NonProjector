DESCRIPTION:

This is a barebones video mixer patch for Apple Quartz Composer®. It can be
as or used as a starting point for your own patches. It is called
"Nonprojection" because it was created for and used at two concerts of music
by musicians from the record label NonProjects® (see http://nonprojects.net).

Some of the features include:

-- Mix two video sources, one camera, and one image
-- Control video playback speed, saturation, brightness and contrast
-- Control camera alpha, red, green, blue, saturation and brightness
-- Control image blending modes, alpha, and zoom
-- Hook up your own MIDI, OSC, or HID devices through Quartz Composer to 
   control the above properties
-- Free, Open Source, DIY, Minimal

Have fun. Feedback is appreciated.

The software is open source and hosted on Github® at 
http://github.com/rcaceres/nonprojector.

GETTING STARTED:

Check out the two tutorial videos for help on getting started:

First set up the user input by assigning midi cc values to as many of the
parameters as you need. Next, load some videos into the video sources. You can
try an image, too. The brightness, contrast, and saturation usually need to be
tweaked before the video becomes visible.
