DESCRIPTION:

This is a barebones video mixer patch for Apple Quartz Composer速. It can be
as or used as a starting point for your own patches. It is called
"Nonprojector" because it was created for and used at two concerts of music
by musicians from the record label NonProjects速 (see http://nonprojects.net).

Some of the features include:

-- Mix two video sources, one camera, and one image
-- Control video playback speed, saturation, brightness and contrast
-- Control camera alpha, red, green, blue, saturation and brightness
-- Control image blending modes, alpha, and zoom
-- Hook up your own MIDI, OSC, or HID devices through Quartz Composer to 
   control the above properties
-- Free, Open Source, DIY, Minimal
    
Have fun. Feedback is appreciated.

The software is open source and hosted on Github速 at 
http://github.com/rcaceres/nonprojector.

GETTING STARTED:

Check out the two tutorial videos for help on getting started:
01 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glr_HuwdWWU
02 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FRYPPk-Ogk

First set up the user input by assigning midi cc values to as many of the
parameters as you need. Next, load some videos into the video sources. You can
try an image, too. The brightness, contrast, and saturation usually need to be
tweaked before the video becomes visible.
